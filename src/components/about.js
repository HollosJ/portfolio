          Hello! &#x1F44B; I'm James - a front-end developer based in &#x1F4CD;
          North-West England - who loves working with the latest technologies to
          create quick and responsive web-applications.

          &#x1F4AA; I have a firm grasp of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as
          good knowledge of various frameworks, libraries and tools. Coding has
          been a hobby of mine for around 7 years.
        </p>

          &#x1F4BC; I'm currently working remotely as a developer for a mortgage
          advice company. Here I am using such technologies as Tailwind,
